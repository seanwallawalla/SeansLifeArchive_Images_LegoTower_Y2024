I had to skip my session again today due to a lack of time. I worked on other projects today, as I have struggling with the time change. I can't keep skipping these sessions, as my time with my device is limited. Recently, the back of the phone (Samsung Galaxy S20 FE) has start to come loose, and causes the screen to flicker when pulled too far. It is unacceptable for devices to be made this cheap when they cost over $1000 (within the first 2 weeks, the SIM card failed, within 6 months, the charging port, within 2 years, the speakers are severely damaged, the microphone also got severely damaged at some point, and now, less than 4 years in, the screen is falling off) I am not buying a Samsung phone again (the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge had most of the same problems within 4 years, except for the microphone, SIM card, and screen failure) and I am still working on a plan to cut Android entirely (outside of a virtual machine) - 2023, Thursday, November 9th

- I returned for my first session of 2024, and played for a long time. My session may have used too much of my time today, but I had a good time. I again had issues sleeping last night, so I woke up early enough to have a really long session fully within the morning.
- I did collection, restocking, quests, and elevator trips, having a session that lasted well over an hour.
- I began construction on my 80th floor today (a residential level) and construction on my 81st floor today (a service level)
- I quit after restocking 2 of 3 / 3 of 3 of all floors.
- I completed 5 character quests today, along with many other quests, earning 1,725 bux today (starting with 35,799 bux, and ending with 37,524 bux, while spending 0 bux)
- I additional unlocked 5 new pieces today.
- I have a goal of reaching 100 floors.
- I used a couple of VIPs today.
- I moved in 5 new residents today.
- I am also still considering updating the game. I am starting to consider not doing it, as 40 character quests seems like it is going to be a nightmare, and I know they have added more since then. Then again, it is starting to look like I don't have a choice.
- I had a good time playing, and eventually quit. - 2024, Thursday, January 4th
